# IMP-001: Export Individual Documents

## Status

- [x] Proposed
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Abandoned

## Details

- **Created**: 2023-10-10
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Affects**: Export Functionality

## Description

Currently, the application exports the entire design document as a single file. This improvement proposes to export each section of the design document as individual files.

## Current Behavior

The application combines all sections of the design document into a single file and exports it.

## Desired Behavior

Each section of the design document should be exported as a separate file. The user should be able to select a directory, and the application will create individual files for each section within that directory.

## Benefits

- Easier to manage and review individual sections.
- Allows for more granular version control.
- Improves collaboration by enabling team members to work on different sections independently.

## Implementation Ideas

- Modify the `combineDocumentContent` function to handle individual sections.
- Update the export logic to create multiple files instead of one.
- Provide a user interface for selecting the export directory.

## Notes

Consider adding a configuration option to toggle between single file and multiple file export modes.

## Completion Notes

When implemented, ensure that the export functionality is thoroughly tested to handle various edge cases, such as sections with similar names.
